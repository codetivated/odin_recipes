    <li>Fresh chili peppers, sliced</li>
    <li>Hoisin sauce (optional)</li>
    <li>Sriracha (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place beef bones and oxtails in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the bones under cold water.</li>
    <li>In a clean pot, add the rinsed bones, oxtails, halved onion, and sliced ginger. Fill with water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for at least 3 hours, skimming off any foam.</li>
    <li>Toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick, black cardamom (if using), coriander seeds, and fennel seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the toasted spices to the pot.</li>
    <li>After simmering for 3 hours, remove the bones and oxtails from the broth. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into another pot to remove solids. Return the clear broth to the stove.</li>
    <li>Add fish sauce, salt, and sugar to the broth to taste. Continue to simmer on low heat.</li>
    <li>Cook the flat rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Slice the cooked beef brisket or flank steak thinly against the grain.</li>
    <li>To serve, place a portion of cooked rice noodles in each bowl. Top with slices of cooked brisket, thinly sliced raw beef, and green onions.</li>
    <li>Ladle the hot broth over the meat and noodles to cook the raw beef. Garnish with bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, mint (if using), lime wedges, and sliced chili peppers.</li>
    <li>Serve with hoisin sauce and sriracha on the side for additional seasoning.</li>
  </ol>
